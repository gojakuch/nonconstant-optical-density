# Nonconstant Optical Density
A light particle travels through a material (represented as a scalar field) and changes its direction accordingly. This field represents a possibly nonconstant optical density. The model is built by approximating the classical Snell's law locally and discretizing the environment. This sometimes results to chaotic and complex behaviour. The work is presented as a Python interactive notebook with the further description of the model, formulae, and analysis.
